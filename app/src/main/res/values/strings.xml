    <string name = "summary">CareerQuest is a program that allows for people to take their skills and interests and be matched to a career they’ll love to pursue.
\n\nOften, we see kids being pushed towards a career they don’t want, because of social pressure, parental influence, or monetary motivation. We believe that all kids should be able to pick a career based on what they love to do. However, often they are not even introduced to career possibilities that align with their interests.
\n\nThe goal of CareerQuest is to allow kids to see the possibilities for a lifelong career, to let them choose something they really like doing. </string>
